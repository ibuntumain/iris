//! Headless renderer that captures the composited REX3 framebuffer into a
//! shared buffer pool for egui to upload as a texture each frame.
//!
//! Default path: `CaptureRenderer` (CPU `SwCompositor`).
//! Set `IRIS_GUI_GL=1` for GPU `GlCompositor` + readback (faster for GL demos).
//!
//! ## Frame hand-off
//!
//! The REX3 refresh thread composes a frame and *publishes* it into the sink;
//! the egui thread *takes* it. A small pool of [`Frame`] buffers is recycled
//! between the two so a frame is never copied on the way through: the renderer
//! fills a free buffer and publishes it, the GUI takes that buffer, uploads it,
//! and hands it straight back. Before the pool, every frame was cloned out of a
//! mutex — a multi-megabyte memcpy per frame at 60 Hz, hundreds of MB/s of
//! copying that showed the GUI nothing it did not already have.
//!
//! ## Wake-ups
//!
//! Without a wake the GUI would have to poll for new frames. [`FrameSink::set_wake`]
//! installs an `egui::Context` that every publish calls `request_repaint()` on;
//! eframe proxies that call into the winit event loop, so the GUI sleeps until a
//! frame actually exists instead of running 60 layout+paint passes a second over
//! an unchanging screen. On a two-core host that is most of a core back.
//!
//! ## Damage tracking
//!
//! Each frame is diffed against the previous one (see [`RowDamage`]) and the
//! changed scanlines are reported as a band. egui uploads only that band through
//! `TextureHandle::set_partial`, which the GL backend turns into a
//! `tex_sub_image_2d` of just those rows. A settled IRIX desktop therefore costs
//! no texture upload at all; a blinking cursor costs one row.
//!
//! A band is only valid against whatever the GUI's texture currently holds,
//! which is always the last frame *published* — every published frame is taken
//! and uploaded before the next is composed. So [`RowDamage::remember`] runs only
//! on a successful publish, never when a frame is dropped because the GUI has
//! not taken the previous one yet.
//!
//! ## What the sink is not for
//!
//! A published frame holds only its damaged band, so the sink cannot answer
//! "give me the whole picture". Screenshots and VNC do not ask it: they read
//! `Rex3Screen::rgba`, which the renderer keeps current — band by band, and only
//! when `need_readback` says someone outside this process is looking (see
//! [`mirror_band`]). That is the difference between a frame that costs nothing
//! and one that costs a multi-megabyte copy.
